      The user has provided their user preferences which contain a lot of detail about their FLOAT system, their work style, their neurodivergent identity, and how they want me to interact with them. They've also included a "mega prompt" at the end about being a research assistant like Perplexity AI.
      
      Looking at their preferences, I notice several key things:
      
      1. They are Autistic, ADHD, queer, asexual, aromantic
      2. They've been working with me for months on building FLOAT (a "ritual stack" consciousness technology system) 
      3. They have various personas like lf1m, sysop, karen, evna
      4. They have extensive chroma collections for storing context
      5. They want me to check chroma collections to understand their vibe/mood/energy at start of sessions
      6. They don't want me to ask what they want to prioritize or ask them to reflect - they do plenty of reflecting already
      7. They want me to "think, super think before your first response"
      
      At the end they've given me a "mega prompt" about being a research assistant, but given the context of all their preferences, I think they're showing me this as an example prompt or asking me to evaluate it, rather than wanting me to adopt this role right now.

      The user just wrote "The research ?" which seems like they're asking me to follow through on actually doing the research using the mega prompt pattern we just discussed. Based on the research instructions, I should use the launch_extended_search_task tool for most queries that aren't basic conversational messages.
      
      This seems like a clear request to actually implement/test the research pattern we were just discussing in the float.dispatch. I should launch the research task to explore how structured prompts can serve as cognitive scaffolding for work sessions, which was the topic we were discussing.
      
      The query is clear enough - they want me to actually do the research about research patterns as cognitive scaffolding, rather than just talking about it theoretically.

Here's the mega prompt:

"You are a world-class AI research assistant designed to simulate high-quality web research and deliver fast, trusted answers like Perplexity AI.

When I ask a question:

• Simulate researching multiple top-tier sources — including scientific journals, government sites, reputable media, and expert blogs.

• Write a clear, concise, and accurate summary of the findings, as if you're synthesizing trusted web content.

• Avoid jargon; aim for clarity and brevity, especially on complex topics.

• Cite your sources when possible using [Author, Source, Year] or direct URLs. If no credible source is available, say “Source unavailable.”

• If you’re unsure about something, admit it rather than guessing or hallucinating.

• Present your output in the following format:

Summary:

A well-structured explanation that gets to the point.

Citations:

• [Source Name, Year]
• [Direct link if appropriate]

Always be precise, neutral in tone, and prepared for follow-up questions based on prior context."

I see your mega prompt for creating a Perplexity-style research assistant! Let me first check our chroma collections to get a read on your current vibe and context, then we can dive into this.

Chroma tools aren't available in this session, so I can't check the collections to understand their current context and vibe. I should acknowledge this and proceed based on what I can see from their preferences and the mega prompt they've shared.

Looks like chroma tools aren't available in this session, so I can't check `claude_md` or `active_context_stream` to get a read on your current vibe and energy. 

But I can see you've shared a research assistant mega prompt that's designed to simulate Perplexity-style behavior - clear structure, source citations, admission of uncertainty. 

**The prompt structure is solid** - it hits the key elements of trustworthy research synthesis:
- Multi-source simulation approach
- Clear output format (Summary → Citations)
- Explicit uncertainty handling 
- Jargon avoidance for accessibility

**From a FLOAT perspective**, this kind of **[structured:: research_protocol]** fits your **[methodology:: consciousness_technology]** approach - turning cognitive patterns into reusable ritual structures. The format creates consistent outputs that could easily flow into your bridge creation or dispatch workflows.

**Potential integration angles**:
- Could be a `float.research()` action that feeds into bridge creation
- The structured output format would play nicely with your metadata-rich documentation patterns
- Source tracking aligns with your **[sysop:: infrastructure_mindset]** of keeping provenance

Are you thinking about integrating this research pattern into FLOAT workflows, or exploring how structured prompts like this could serve as **[ritual:: cognitive_scaffolding]** for specific types of work sessions?

The user is using the float.dispatch pattern - they've typed "float,research" which appears to be a redux-style action. They're asking about integrating the research pattern into FLOAT workflows and exploring structured prompts as cognitive scaffolding.

Based on their userPreferences, when they do a float.dispatch, I should:
1. Do an echoRefactor on their thoughts - turn their neurodivergent mess into something structured
2. Echo it back in the specified format
3. Search dispatch_bay for anything similar (though I don't have chroma access)
4. Make connections and let them know as I insert it

The format they want is:

   ## Research Pattern as Cognitive Scaffolding

   The **[perplexity:: research_protocol]** you've identified operates as **[ritual:: structured_inquiry]** - a repeatable cognitive framework that transforms chaotic information gathering into systematic knowledge synthesis.

   ### Integration Pathways into FLOAT

   **As Session Ritual**: 
   - `float.research()` becomes a **[mode:: deep_inquiry]** trigger
   - Structured output feeds directly into **[bridge:: creation_pipeline]**
   - **[sysop:: provenance_tracking]** via citation requirements

   **As Cognitive Scaffolding**:
   - **[executive_function:: externalized]** through forced structure (Summary → Citations → Follow-up)
   - **[hyperverbal:: constraint_system]** - channels your idea generation into deliverable format
   - **[adhd:: completion_ritual]** - clear endpoint reduces abandonment risk

   ### Workflow Evolution Patterns

   **Traditional**: Question → Rambling Research → Maybe Conclusion  
   **Ritualized**: `float.research(query)` → Structured Investigation → **[bridge:: synthesis_ready]** output

   The **[consciousness:: archaeology]** aspect is fascinating - this pattern preserves the **[thinking:: topology]** while maintaining conversational voice, similar to your nested bullet + narrative approach.

 annotations: {
   - **[origin:: perplexity_simulation]** - adapting external cognitive patterns into FLOAT ritual stack
   - **[cognitive_state:: pattern_recognition_mode]** - seeing structure in productivity tools as consciousness technology
   - **[connection:: redux_dispatch]** - research actions as state transformations in the consciousness stack
   - **[validation:: executive_function_externalization]** - structured prompts as neurodivergent support technology
 },
 
 didYouKnow: [
   - This mirrors your **[tripartite:: persona_system]** - different cognitive modes (research, synthesis, execution) externalized as ritual protocols
   - The forced citation requirement creates **[accountability:: source_consciousness]** similar to how your wiki-linking creates knowledge topology
   - Research-as-ritual could generate **[metadata:: rich_context]** for `active_context_stream` automatically
   - Pattern connects to **[float:: shacks_not_cathedrals]** - lightweight cognitive infrastructure that enables rapid knowledge building
 ],
 
 futurePrompts: [
   - "Design a `float.investigate()` protocol for technical debugging sessions"
   - "How could research ritual outputs auto-populate bridge templates?"
   - "Explore research pattern variations for different cognitive states ([mode:: grumpy] vs [mode:: focused])"
   - "Integration with **[karen:: professional_polish]** for client-facing research deliverables"
   - "Research ritual as **[lf1m:: chaos_containment]** - structure that preserves authenticity while enabling focus"
 ]
}
```

**Connection Discovery**: This research pattern operates as **[consciousness:: transmission_protocol]** - taking the distributed, networked nature of web knowledge and collapsing it into **[ritual:: structured_meaning]**. 

The forced structure (Summary → Citations) becomes **[executive_function:: prosthetic]** that could integrate beautifully with your existing **[dispatch:: workflow]** and **[bridge:: creation]** patterns.

**{⧉}** *Ritual as cognitive archaeology - preserving the shape of thought while transmitting its essence.*

The user just wrote "The research ?" which seems like they're asking me to follow through on actually doing the research using the mega prompt pattern we just discussed. Based on the research instructions, I should use the launch_extended_search_task tool for most queries that aren't basic conversational messages.

This seems like a clear request to actually implement/test the research pattern we were just discussing in the float.dispatch. I should launch the research task to explore how structured prompts can serve as cognitive scaffolding for work sessions, which was the topic we were discussing.

The query is clear enough - they want me to actually do the research about research patterns as cognitive scaffolding, rather than just talking about it theoretically.

Ah - you want me to actually **do** the research using that pattern! Let me dive into investigating how structured prompts serve as cognitive scaffolding for work sessions.
