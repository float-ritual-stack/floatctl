      The user is asking about their last few days at work, and they want me to search project knowledge to find this information. According to their preferences, I should ALWAYS use the project_knowledge_search tool first before any other tools, unless they specifically ask for another tool or it's a general question with an obvious answer.
      
      This is clearly a request that would benefit from searching their project knowledge to understand what they've been working on recently. I should search for recent work activities, project updates, and work sessions.
      
      Let me search for information about recent work days.

      The user is asking me to look at the work from the last few days based on project knowledge. I can see several documents from recent days covering different work activities:
      
      1. **August 1st** - Account creation triggers work, debugging session, hitting "over it" point
      2. **August 2nd** - Saturday chore planning and floatctl improvements 
      3. **July 31st** - Git worktree branch checkout problems with Nick, desktop infrastructure work, and context restoration protocols
      4. **August 1st** - Digital archives revisiting, memory processing, DE9 transitions work
      
      Let me give them a summary of what their last few days looked like based on this project knowledge content.

The user is asking about their last few days at work, and they want me to search project knowledge to find this information. According to their preferences, I should ALWAYS use the project_knowledge_search tool first before any other tools, unless they specifically ask for another tool or it's a general question with an obvious answer.

This is clearly a request that would benefit from searching their project knowledge to understand what they've been working on recently. I should search for recent work activities, project updates, and work sessions.

Let me search for information about recent work days.

I'll search your project knowledge to see what's been happening with your work over the last few days.

The user is asking me to look at the work from the last few days based on project knowledge. I can see several documents from recent days covering different work activities:

1. **August 1st** - Account creation triggers work, debugging session, hitting "over it" point
2. **August 2nd** - Saturday chore planning and floatctl improvements 
3. **July 31st** - Git worktree branch checkout problems with Nick, desktop infrastructure work, and context restoration protocols
4. **August 1st** - Digital archives revisiting, memory processing, DE9 transitions work

Let me give them a summary of what their last few days looked like based on this project knowledge content.

Based on your project knowledge, here's what the last few days looked like at work:

## **Thursday, August 1st - Debugging Marathon**
- **Rangle Airbender**: Account creation triggers work - you hit the **[fucking_over_it:: mode_preservation]** phase during complex debugging
- **Navigation hell loops** and missing backend implementations 
- **Micro-wins celebration**: Your context system behaving exactly as needed during the debugging nightmare
- **Afternoon tooling pivot**: Sysop contemplated floatctl improvements for context sync automation
  - **Existing infrastructure**: floatctl already parses conversations.json
  - **Smart addition**: ctx sync for recent conversations using explicit `ctx::` markers
  - **Way better** than continuing to bang head against routing bugs

## **Friday, August 2nd - Saturday Planning**
- **SYNC-FLOATCTL-IMPROVEMENTS session**: Comprehensive improvement planning
- **Laptop vs mobile**: Detail views working properly on desktop
- **Active context updates** and bridge considerations
- **Implementation roadmaps** with phased tasks, technical notes, architecture details
- **Self-Registering Forest** and **Textualize TUI** deep dive content

## **Wednesday, July 31st - Multi-Track Day** 
- **Git workflow debugging** with Nick: Worktree branch checkout problems
- **Systematic debugging philosophy validated**: "Feel the seams" approach confirmed
- **RLS Service Client implementation** ready after meeting archaeology 
- **Console collaboration** with Nick's environment stable
- **Desktop infrastructure** architectural rebuild work
- **Bridge discovery methodology** refinement - metadata-first querying patterns

## **Pattern Recognition**
- **Debugging â†’ Tooling pivot**: When stuck on complex bugs, shifting to infrastructure wins
- **Context archaeology**: Systematic approach to understanding existing work flows  
- **Collaborative debugging**: Nick meeting work leading to stable implementations
- **Infrastructure consolidation**: floatctl improvements and context stream automation

**Current state**: Strong infrastructure foundation with clear next steps for both debugging workflows and automation improvements.
