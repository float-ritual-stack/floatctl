- [ ] **Implement cleanup routines** for temporary files
- [ ] **Add storage quota management** and monitoring

### **Phase 4: Developer Experience** (Week 7)
*Goal: Improve development workflow and debugging capabilities*

#### 4.1 Development Tools
- [ ] **Create plugin scaffolding** CLI commands
- [ ] **Add debugging utilities** and inspection tools
- [ ] **Implement development mode** with enhanced logging
- [ ] **Create plugin documentation** generator
- [ ] **Add code quality checks** and linting rules

#### 4.2 Documentation & Examples
- [ ] **Update all plugin CLAUDE.md** files with new patterns
- [ ] **Create comprehensive API documentation**
- [ ] **Add plugin development tutorial**
- [ ] **Create example plugins** for common patterns
- [ ] **Document migration guides** for breaking changes

## üõ°Ô∏è **Backwards Compatibility Strategy**

### **Compatibility Guarantees**
1. **CLI Interface**: All existing commands and options remain functional
2. **Plugin API**: Existing plugins continue to work without modification
3. **Configuration**: Old config files are automatically migrated
4. **Database**: Schema migrations preserve all existing data
5. **File Formats**: All current input/output formats supported

### **Deprecation Process**
1. **Deprecation Warnings**: 2 releases before removal
2. **Migration Guides**: Clear upgrade paths for deprecated features
3. **Compatibility Shims**: Temporary bridges for breaking changes
4. **Version Pinning**: Allow users to pin to stable versions

### **Testing Strategy**
1. **Regression Tests**: Comprehensive suite covering all existing functionality
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflows with real data
3. **Compatibility Tests**: Verify old configs and plugins still work
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensure no performance regressions

## üìã **Implementation Guidelines**

### **Development Principles**
- **Incremental Changes**: Small, reviewable commits
- **Test-First**: Write tests before implementation
- **Documentation**: Update docs with every change
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Never break existing functionality
- **Performance**: Measure before and after changes

### **Quality Gates**
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 60% for new code
- **Performance**: No regressions in processing speed
- **Memory Usage**: No significant memory leaks
- **Error Handling**: All error paths tested
- **Documentation**: All public APIs documented

### **Review Process**
- **Code Reviews**: All changes reviewed by maintainer
- **Integration Testing**: Full test suite passes
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmark comparisons
- **Documentation Review**: Ensure clarity and completeness
- **User Testing**: Validate with real workflows

## üöÄ **Success Metrics**

### **Technical Metrics**
- **Test Coverage**: 13% ‚Üí 60%+
- **Plugin Load Time**: <500ms for all plugins
- **Memory Usage**: <200MB for typical workflows
- **Error Recovery**: 95% of errors handled gracefully
- **Performance**: No regression in processing speed

### **Developer Experience Metrics**
- **Plugin Development Time**: 50% reduction for new plugins
- **Debug Time**: 60% reduction in issue resolution
- **Documentation Coverage**: 100% of public APIs
- **Developer Onboarding**: <1 hour to first plugin

### **Operational Metrics**

- **Observability**: Full tracing for all operations
- **Recovery Time**: <5 minutes for most failures
- **Maintenance Overhead**: 50% reduction in manual tasks

## üéØ **Next Steps**

1. **Review and Approve Roadmap** - Validate approach and timeline
2. **Set Up Development Environment** - Ensure all tools and dependencies
3. **Create Milestone Tracking** - GitHub issues and project board
4. **Begin Phase 1** - Start with test infrastructure enhancement
5. **Establish Review Cadence** - Weekly progress reviews and adjustments
