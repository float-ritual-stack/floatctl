Give a clear example\n\nThinking blocks contain the AI's internal reasoning process that happens before generating a response. This is valuable for understanding decision-making.\n</thinking>\n\nThinking blocks are internal reasoning sections that AI systems use to process and plan responses before presenting them to users. They typically contain:\n\n1. **Analysis** of the user's request\n2. **Planning** of the response structure\n3. **Decision-making** about what to include\n4. **Pattern recognition** from the conversation context\n\nThese blocks are usually hidden from the final output but contain valuable insights into the AI's reasoning process.",
