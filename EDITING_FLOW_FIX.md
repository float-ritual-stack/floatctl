# Python Editing Flow Blocker - Resolution Summary

## The Problem
You were experiencing a blocker with the Python editing flow in floatctl-py. The interactive interfaces were being interfered with by verbose logging output during plugin loading.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Initial Hypothesis**: Shell completion interference
   - We thought `_FLOATCTL_COMPLETE` environment variable was causing issues
   - Testing showed this wasn't the actual problem

2. **Actual Issue**: Plugin loading verbosity
   - Plugins were loaded BEFORE CLI configuration was parsed
   - This meant verbose/quiet settings weren't respected during initial plugin loading
   - Every plugin load was logging to console, interfering with interactive UIs

## The Fix

### 1. Quiet Initial Logging (Primary Fix)
Added `setup_quiet_logging()` function to redirect initial plugin loading logs to `/dev/null`:

```python
# In src/floatctl/core/logging.py
def setup_quiet_logging() -> None:
    """Set up minimal logging for initial plugin loading."""
    structlog.configure(
        processors=[...],
        logger_factory=structlog.WriteLoggerFactory(file=open(os.devnull, "w")),
        cache_logger_on_first_use=True,
    )

# In src/floatctl/cli.py main()
if not os.environ.get('_FLOATCTL_COMPLETE'):
    setup_quiet_logging()  # Silent during plugin loading
# ... then later setup_logging() with user preferences
```

### 2. Enhanced Selection Visibility
The selection highlight in float-simple was too subtle:

```python
# Changed from:
line = f"[bold]{indent}[green]➤[/green] {time_str} {content}[/bold]"

# To:
line = f"[bold white on blue]{indent}➤ {time_str} {content}[/bold white on blue]"
```

Also added position indicator in subtitle: "REPL OFF | Entry 3/10"

### 3. Fixed REPL Plugin Error
The REPL plugin was trying to use prompt_toolkit without checking availability:

```python
# Fixed initialization
if AVAILABLE:
    self.input_buffer = Buffer(multiline=True)
else:
    self.input_buffer = None

# Added check in command
if not AVAILABLE:
    console.print("[red]Error: prompt_toolkit is not installed.[/red]")
    console.print("Install with: [yellow]uv pip install prompt_toolkit[/yellow]")
    return
```

## Results

1. **Clean Startup**: No more verbose plugin loading messages
2. **Better Visibility**: Selected entries now clearly visible with white-on-blue highlighting
3. **Position Tracking**: Subtitle shows current position in entry list
4. **Proper Error Handling**: REPL shows helpful error if dependencies missing

## Available Interfaces

All three interfaces now work without logging interference:
- `floatctl float-simple` - Low friction, simplified interface (recommended)
- `floatctl float` - Full Textual interface with tree view
- `floatctl repl` - prompt_toolkit based REPL (requires `uv pip install -e ".[repl]"`)

## Testing

To test the improvements:
```bash
# Test the simplified interface with better highlighting
uv run floatctl float-simple

# Navigation:
# - Alt+↑/↓ to move between entries
# - Tab/Shift+Tab to indent
# - Ctrl+R to toggle REPL mode
# - Ctrl+C to exit
```

The selected entry should now be VERY visible with white text on a blue background!
