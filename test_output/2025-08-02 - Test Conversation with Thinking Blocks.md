      The user is asking about thinking blocks. I should:
      1. Explain what they are
      2. Show how they work
      3. Give a clear example
      
      Thinking blocks contain the AI's internal reasoning process that happens before generating a response. This is valuable for understanding decision-making.

      The user wants an example with tool use. I should:
      - Use a file reading tool as an example
      - Show the thinking process around tool selection
      - Demonstrate how thinking blocks work with tool calls

# Test Conversation with Thinking Blocks

## Conversation

### ðŸ‘¤ Human
- start_time:: 2025-08-02T03:50:00Z

Can you help me understand how thinking blocks work?

Thinking blocks contain the AI's internal reasoning process that happens before generating a response. This is valuable for understanding decision-making.

Thinking blocks are internal reasoning sections that AI systems use to process and plan responses before presenting them to users. They typically contain:

1. **Analysis** of the user's request
2. **Planning** of the response structure
3. **Decision-making** about what to include
4. **Pattern recognition** from the conversation context

These blocks are usually hidden from the final output but contain valuable insights into the AI's reasoning process.

Can you show me another example with tool use?

The user wants an example with tool use. I should:
- Use a file reading tool as an example
- Show the thinking process around tool selection
- Demonstrate how thinking blocks work with tool calls
</thinking>

I'll read a file to demonstrate how thinking blocks work with tool usage.
{Tool Call: toolu_01ABC â†’ 2025-08-02 - Test Conversation with Thinking Blocks.tool_calls.jsonl:1}
{Tool Result: toolu_01ABC â†’ 2025-08-02 - Test Conversation with Thinking Blocks.tool_calls.jsonl:2}
As you can see, the thinking block helped me decide which tool to use and why.
